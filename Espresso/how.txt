So here a java class file is given (expresso.class)

.class is a compiled version of .java file

{
    .java file is compressed using 
    
    javac hello.java (filename) this gives the hello.class

    now to run hello.class file

    java hello  (this runs the java class file)

}

now in this challenge expresso.class file is given. so it is compiled so we 
run the file using 

java expresso

but it gives error so use any javadecompilers(i used online decompiler 
www.javadecompilers.com)
which should give you the java file (expresso.java)
open it with a text editor go through it
it has a key and a cipher variable
which is used for to printout to localstringbuffer variable


 The only two things i did i deleted the package file com.hackinglab.ctf
and inserted system.out.println(localStringBuffer) after the loop to get the 
flag. 

and compile the file again using javac Espresso.java and i get a Expresso.class
 file, then i used (java Expresso abc) since it needed a flag abc was given
